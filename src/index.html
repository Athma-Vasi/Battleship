						In a time of crisis, the Star Kingdom of Manticore faces a grave threat from
						the treacherous People's Republic of Haven. Their aggression and lust for
						power has forced us into a war we did not seek. However, as loyal subjects of
						Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth III, it is our duty to defend our homeland and
						protect our people from harm!
					</p>

					<p class="greetings1">
						The enemy seeks to destroy our way of life, but we will not falter! Our brave
						sailors and soldiers stand ready to defend the Kingdom with honor and courage.
						We will not rest until the threat of Haven is neutralized, and our people can
						live in peace and prosperity once again.
					</p>

					<p class="greetings2">
						We call upon all loyal citizens of the Star Kingdom to rally behind our cause
						and join us in this fight for our survival! Together, we will show the world
						that the people of Manticore will never back down in the face of tyranny and
						oppression!
					</p>

					<p class="greetings3">
						People's Republic of Haven has assembled a formidable fleet near the Talbott
						Cluster, commanded by the traitor Admiral Esther McQueen, and are poised to
						launch an invasion of the Rembrandt Trade Union. The brave people of Rembrandt
						have reached out to us for assistance in the face of this imminent threat,
						pledging their loyalty to the Kingdom upon the successful repulsion of the
						Haven forces. As staunch defenders of peace and justice, we cannot turn a
						blind eye to their plight and will stand by our allies in their hour of need.
						Our fleet has been mobilized and will soon join the battle to ensure the
						safety and sovereignty of the Rembrandt Trade Union.
					</p>
					<p class="greetings4">
						You have been called upon to engage and defeat the Haven Fleet and secure
						peace and prosperity for the Star Kingdom and its allies!
